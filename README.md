# Bitburner HWGW Hacking Scripts

Automated HWGW (Hack-Weaken-Grow-Weaken) system for Bitburner.

## Quick Start (In Bitburner)

1. Copy this single command to your terminal:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheeseonhead/bb-for-fun/main/update.js update.js
```

2. Run the updater:
```
run update.js
```

3. Start the hacking system:
```
run hack-v1/launcher.js
```

That's it! The updater will download everything else.

## Updating

Whenever you want the latest version:
```
run update.js
```

## How It Works

- **update.js**: Simple script you keep in Bitburner
  - Downloads the latest `download.js` from GitHub
  - Runs it automatically

- **download.js**: Auto-generated by pre-commit hook
  - Contains complete list of all files in the repo
  - Downloads everything to your Bitburner instance
  - Cleans up old files automatically

## For Developers

### Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. The pre-commit hook is already set up via `.git/hooks/pre-commit` symlink

### How It Works

When you commit changes:
1. Pre-commit hook (`scripts/pre-commit.js`) runs automatically
2. Scans all tracked .js files in the repo
3. Generates `download.js` with the complete file list
4. Stages `download.js` for commit

This means `download.js` is always in sync with your repo contents.

### File Structure

```
/update.js              # User's entry point (simple, rarely changes)
/download.js            # Auto-generated by pre-commit hook
/scripts/
  /pre-commit.js        # Pre-commit hook logic
/.git/hooks/
  /pre-commit          # Symlink to scripts/pre-commit.js
/hack-v1/              # HWGW system scripts
  /launcher.js         # Main coordinator
  /manager.js          # Server management
  /scheduler.js        # Operation scheduler
  /workers/            # Minimal worker scripts
```

### Adding New Files

Just add your .js files to the repo and commit - the hook handles the rest!

### Testing Pre-commit Hook

```bash
# Manually run the hook
node scripts/pre-commit.js

# Check generated download.js
cat download.js
```

## System Architecture

The HWGW system uses a split architecture for RAM optimization:

- **Launcher** (~2GB): Lightweight coordinator, runs on home
- **Manager** (~3GB): Scans/roots/deploys, runs on best available server
- **Scheduler** (~3GB): Target analysis and operation scheduling
- **Workers** (1.75GB each): Minimal hack/grow/weaken scripts

This allows the system to run even on a 8GB home server by offloading heavy tasks to rooted servers.
